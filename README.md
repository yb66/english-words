english-words
=============

A text file containing 355k-ish English words

Note: This is a fork of [docdis/english-words](https://github.com/docdis/english-words) where I attempt to change the spellings to British English and cull any words that appear to have no place in history or, indeed, in existence.

While searching for a list of english words (for an auto-complete tutorial)
I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213607/how-to-get-english-language-word-database which refers to http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable 

No idea why infochimps put the word list inside an excel (.xls) file.

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

<strike>Copyright still belongs to them.</strike> This is a list of words, there is no *original work* here, just effort, and as such, has no copyright. Use it wisely!

words3.txt is a new list I've cobbled together from different sources. A lot of it is still rubbish and full of obviously made up words but I'm slowly cleaning it up.
